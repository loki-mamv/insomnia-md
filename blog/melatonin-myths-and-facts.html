        <h1>Melatonin Myths and Facts: What the Research Actually Shows</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Melatonin is the best-selling sleep supplement in the United States. It's also one of the most misunderstood. Most people take too much, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. Here's what the clinical evidence actually says.</p>

        <h2>What Melatonin Is (and Isn't)</h2>
        <p>Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland in response to darkness. It doesn't make you sleep. It signals to your body that it's nighttime, helping to regulate the timing of your circadian rhythm. This distinction matters because it changes how and when melatonin supplementation makes sense.</p>
        <p>Your body typically begins producing melatonin about two hours before your natural bedtime, a period researchers call dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). Production peaks in the middle of the night and drops off toward morning. Bright light, particularly in the blue spectrum, suppresses this production. That's the entire system. Melatonin is a timing signal, not a sedative.</p>

        <h2>Myth: More Melatonin Means Better Sleep</h2>
        <p>This is the most common misconception, and the supplement industry has been happy to encourage it. Walk into any pharmacy and you'll find melatonin gummies in doses of 5, 10, even 15 milligrams. These doses are far higher than what the research supports.</p>
        <p>A 2005 study in Sleep Medicine Reviews by Zhdanova and colleagues found that physiological doses of melatonin, between 0.1 and 0.3 milligrams, were sufficient to raise blood melatonin to normal nighttime levels and improve sleep onset. Higher doses raised melatonin far above physiological levels without additional benefit, and in some cases actually disrupted sleep architecture.</p>
        <p>The MIT researchers who conducted some of the foundational melatonin studies have repeatedly noted that commercially available doses are 10 to 50 times higher than what their research indicated was optimal. Richard Wurtman, who holds the original patent on melatonin for sleep, has publicly stated that the effective dose is 0.3 to 1 milligram.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
            <p><strong>Key fact:</strong> Most melatonin supplements contain doses far higher than what research supports. Studies suggest 0.3 to 1 mg is the physiologically appropriate range. Higher doses don't work better and can cause next-day grogginess.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Myth: Melatonin Is an Effective Treatment for Chronic Insomnia</h2>
        <p>The data here is not encouraging for people hoping melatonin will solve their sleep problems. A 2013 meta-analysis published in PLOS ONE by Ferracioli-Oda and colleagues examined 19 randomized controlled trials involving 1,683 participants. They found that melatonin reduced sleep onset latency by an average of 7 minutes and increased total sleep time by about 8 minutes. Both changes were statistically significant but clinically marginal.</p>
        <p>For context, CBT-I typically reduces sleep onset latency by 20 to 30 minutes and increases sleep efficiency by 10 to 15 percentage points. The gap between melatonin's effect and what people expect from it is substantial.</p>
        <p>The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guideline recommended against using melatonin for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia in adults. Not because it's dangerous, but because the evidence for clinically meaningful benefit was weak.</p>

        <h2>Fact: Melatonin Works Well for Specific Conditions</h2>
        <p>Where melatonin shines is in conditions involving circadian rhythm disruption, which makes perfect sense given its role as a timing signal.</p>

        <h3>Jet Lag</h3>
        <p>A Cochrane review of 10 randomized trials found that melatonin taken close to bedtime at the destination significantly reduced jet lag symptoms for travelers crossing five or more time zones. The effective dose was 0.5 to 5 mg, with no clear benefit from higher doses. Timing was more important than dose: taking it at the target bedtime helped reset the internal clock to the new time zone.</p>

        <h3>Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder</h3>
        <p>People whose circadian rhythm is shifted late, the classic "night owl" pattern taken to an extreme, can benefit from low-dose melatonin taken several hours before their desired bedtime. A 2010 study in Sleep found that 0.5 mg melatonin taken five hours before DLMO advanced the circadian clock and improved sleep timing. The key is taking it early enough, typically four to six hours before the desired bedtime, not right before bed.</p>

        <h3>Shift Work</h3>
        <p>Melatonin can help shift workers sleep during the day by signaling nighttime to their disrupted circadian system. A 2014 review in the Journal of Pineal Research found modest but consistent benefits for daytime sleep in night shift workers. Again, timing relative to the desired sleep period matters more than dose.</p>

        <h2>The Quality Control Problem</h2>
        <p>Because melatonin is classified as a dietary supplement in the United States, it is not subject to the same manufacturing standards as prescription drugs. A widely cited 2017 study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine by Erland and Saxena tested 31 melatonin supplements and found that the actual melatonin content ranged from 83% less to 478% more than what was listed on the label. Some supplements also contained serotonin, which was not listed as an ingredient.</p>
        <p>This means even if you're trying to take an appropriate dose, you may not be getting what you think. Choosing products from manufacturers that submit to third-party testing (USP or NSF certification) can reduce this risk.</p>

        <h2>Myth: Melatonin Is Completely Harmless</h2>
        <p>Melatonin is generally safe for short-term use in adults. Side effects are usually mild: headache, dizziness, and daytime drowsiness are the most common. But "generally safe" doesn't mean "take as much as you want indefinitely."</p>
        <p>Long-term safety data in adults is limited. There is also growing concern about melatonin use in children. A 2022 report from the CDC noted a 530% increase in melatonin-related calls to poison control centers between 2012 and 2021, with most involving children. The American Academy of Pediatrics has called for stricter regulation and better labeling.</p>
        <p>Melatonin can interact with several medications, including blood thinners, immunosuppressants, diabetes medications, and contraceptives. People with autoimmune conditions should use caution, as melatonin has immunomodulatory effects. Discussing supplementation with a healthcare provider is reasonable, even though it's available over the counter.</p>

        <h2>Myth: If Melatonin Doesn't Work, You Need a Higher Dose</h2>
        <p>If 3 mg didn't help, the instinct is to try 5, then 10. This is backwards. If melatonin isn't working, the issue is almost certainly not dose. It's either that your problem isn't circadian in nature (and melatonin won't help regardless of dose), or the timing is wrong.</p>
        <p>For chronic insomnia driven by hyperarousal, conditioned wakefulness, or anxiety, melatonin addresses none of the underlying mechanisms. Taking more of it is like turning up the volume on a radio to fix bad reception. The signal isn't the problem.</p>

        <h2>How to Use Melatonin If You're Going to Take It</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dose:</strong> Start with 0.5 mg. If that helps, stay there. You can go up to 1 mg if needed. Doses above 3 mg are almost certainly unnecessary.</li>
            <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Take it one to two hours before your desired bedtime for general use, or four to six hours before for circadian shifting.</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Short-term use for specific situations like jet lag or schedule adjustment. If you've been taking melatonin nightly for months without clear benefit, it's time to try something else.</li>
            <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Choose brands with USP or NSF certification to ensure label accuracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Expectations:</strong> If your insomnia is chronic and not primarily circadian, melatonin is unlikely to be the answer. Discuss CBT-I with your doctor.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
            <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Melatonin is a useful tool for jet lag, delayed sleep phase, and shift work. It is not an effective treatment for most cases of chronic insomnia. The effective dose is much lower than what most products contain. If it hasn't helped after a few weeks, the answer is not more melatonin.</p>
