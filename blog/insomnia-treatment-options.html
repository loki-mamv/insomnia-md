        <h1>Insomnia Treatment Options: A Complete Guide to What Works</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">There are more ways to treat insomnia than at any point in medical history. The challenge isn't finding options; it's knowing which ones are supported by evidence and which are supported by marketing. This guide covers the major categories, what the research shows, and how to think about choosing.</p>

        <h2>First-Line: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia</h2>
        <p>Every evidence-based guideline published in the last decade recommends CBT-I as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia in adults. The American College of Physicians issued this recommendation in 2016. The European Sleep Research Society followed. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine reaffirmed it in 2021. The evidence isn't ambiguous.</p>
        <p>CBT-I is a structured program lasting six to eight sessions that combines sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive therapy, and sleep hygiene education. A 2015 meta-analysis of 20 randomized controlled trials in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that it significantly improved sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and subjective sleep quality. Importantly, these improvements persisted at follow-up assessments months to years after treatment ended.</p>
        <p>The main drawback is access. There are not enough trained CBT-I therapists to meet demand. Wait times of three to six months are common. Digital CBT-I programs have emerged to fill this gap. Somryst (now Pear-004) is an FDA-cleared prescription digital therapeutic, and several non-prescription apps offer CBT-I-based programs. Clinical trials of digital CBT-I show effect sizes smaller than in-person therapy but still clinically meaningful.</p>

        <div class="key-fact">
            <p><strong>Why CBT-I first:</strong> It has the best long-term outcomes of any insomnia treatment, carries no risk of dependence, and teaches skills that patients can use independently for the rest of their lives. Medication effects stop when the medication stops. CBT-I effects persist.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Prescription Medications</h2>
        <p>When CBT-I is not available, not sufficient on its own, or when patients need short-term relief while starting behavioral treatment, medication can play a role. The landscape here is complex and worth understanding.</p>

        <h3>Benzodiazepine Receptor Agonists (Z-Drugs)</h3>
        <p>Zolpidem (Ambien), zaleplon (Sonata), and eszopiclone (Lunesta) are the most commonly prescribed sleep medications. They work by enhancing GABA activity at specific receptor sites, promoting sedation. Clinical trials show they reduce sleep onset latency by 10 to 20 minutes and increase total sleep time by 20 to 40 minutes.</p>
        <p>The downsides are well-documented. Tolerance can develop within weeks to months. Dependence is a real risk with extended use. Complex sleep behaviors, including sleepwalking, sleep-driving, and preparing food while not fully awake, have been reported and prompted an FDA black box warning in 2019. Rebound insomnia when stopping the medication is common and can be worse than the original insomnia.</p>
        <p>The AASM's 2017 clinical practice guideline gave a "weak" recommendation for these medications, noting that the evidence for benefit was modest and needed to be weighed against the risks.</p>

        <h3>Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonists (DORAs)</h3>
        <p>This is the newest class. Suvorexant (Belsomra) and lemborexant (Dayvigo) work by blocking orexin, a neurotransmitter that promotes wakefulness. Rather than sedating you, they reduce the wake signal, which is a fundamentally different approach.</p>
        <p>Clinical trials show improvements in sleep onset and sleep maintenance with a lower risk of tolerance and dependence compared to Z-drugs. A 2020 meta-analysis in the Journal of Clinical Medicine found that DORAs were effective for both sleep onset and maintenance insomnia, with next-day residual effects that were generally mild. They received a conditional recommendation from the AASM in their 2017 guideline, which was before lemborexant's approval.</p>
        <p>These medications are not without issues. Suvorexant can cause next-morning grogginess at higher doses, and there are concerns about rare reports of sleep paralysis and vivid dreams. They are also expensive and often not covered by insurance without prior authorization.</p>

        <h3>Melatonin Receptor Agonists</h3>
        <p>Ramelteon (Rozerem) targets melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 specifically. It is approved for sleep onset difficulty and has a clean safety profile: no evidence of dependence, abuse potential, or rebound insomnia. The trade-off is modest efficacy. Clinical trials show it reduces sleep onset latency by about 9 to 14 minutes, which is statistically significant but not dramatic.</p>
        <p>Ramelteon may be most useful for patients who are uncomfortable with the risks of other sleep medications, older adults who are more sensitive to sedative side effects, and patients with a circadian component to their insomnia.</p>

        <h3>Sedating Antidepressants</h3>
        <p>Low-dose trazodone, doxepin, and mirtazapine are frequently prescribed off-label for insomnia. Doxepin at very low doses (3-6 mg, marketed as Silenor) has the strongest evidence base and an FDA indication for insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep maintenance. A 2014 study in Sleep found that low-dose doxepin improved sleep maintenance without significant next-day effects.</p>
        <p>Trazodone is the most commonly prescribed medication for insomnia in the United States, despite having limited randomized trial data supporting its use specifically for insomnia. It became popular because it's inexpensive, generic, and perceived as safer than Z-drugs. But common side effects include morning grogginess, orthostatic hypotension, and rare but serious cardiac arrhythmias.</p>

        <h3>Medications to Avoid</h3>
        <p>Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl, ZzzQuil) are the most widely used OTC sleep aids. They work, sort of, by blocking histamine receptors. But they have significant anticholinergic effects that become more problematic with age: dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, confusion, and impaired cognition. Tolerance develops rapidly, often within a week. The American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria explicitly recommends against their use in older adults.</p>
        <p>Benzodiazepines like temazepam, lorazepam, and clonazepam are sometimes still prescribed for insomnia. They carry higher risks of dependence, cognitive impairment, falls, and next-day sedation compared to Z-drugs. Most guidelines recommend against their routine use for insomnia.</p>

        <h2>Over-the-Counter and Supplement Options</h2>

        <h3>Melatonin</h3>
        <p>As detailed in our separate article on melatonin, it has limited evidence for chronic insomnia but can be helpful for circadian rhythm disorders, jet lag, and shift work. Effective doses are lower than what most commercial products contain. Quality control is a significant concern since it's unregulated as a supplement.</p>

        <h3>Magnesium</h3>
        <p>Magnesium supplementation for sleep has a small body of supporting evidence. A 2012 study in the Journal of Research in Medical Sciences found that magnesium supplementation improved subjective measures of insomnia in elderly participants. However, the trial was small (46 subjects), and subsequent studies have been mixed. Magnesium is unlikely to be harmful at recommended doses and may provide modest benefit, but the evidence is not strong enough to recommend it as a primary treatment.</p>

        <h3>Valerian Root</h3>
        <p>Valerian has been used as a sleep aid for centuries. The modern clinical evidence is underwhelming. A systematic review in Sleep Medicine (2010) found that valerian did not significantly improve sleep latency, total sleep time, or sleep quality compared to placebo. It appears to be safe but lacks efficacy data to justify a recommendation.</p>

        <h3>CBD</h3>
        <p>Cannabidiol is widely marketed for sleep despite thin evidence. A 2019 case series in The Permanente Journal reported that anxiety scores improved in 79% of patients and sleep scores improved in 67%, but this was observational with no control group. Randomized controlled trials specifically examining CBD for insomnia are scarce. The products are also unregulated, with variable potency and purity. It's too early to recommend CBD for insomnia based on current evidence.</p>

        <h2>Emerging and Alternative Approaches</h2>

        <h3>Intensive Sleep Retraining</h3>
        <p>This is a newer behavioral technique that condenses stimulus control into a single overnight session. The patient is kept awake all night in the lab and given a series of brief (20-minute) sleep opportunities, being woken at the first signs of sleep onset. The idea is to rapidly recondition the association between the bed and falling asleep. A 2012 pilot study in Sleep by Harris and colleagues showed promising results, and subsequent trials have been positive. It's being investigated as a faster alternative to traditional CBT-I for patients who can't commit to six to eight weeks of therapy.</p>

        <h3>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Insomnia</h3>
        <p>ACT approaches insomnia differently than CBT-I. Rather than trying to control thoughts and behaviors around sleep, ACT focuses on accepting sleep-related distress and reducing the struggle against insomnia. Early studies suggest it may be particularly helpful for patients who don't respond well to the more structured CBT-I approach. A 2019 randomized trial in Behavior Therapy found ACT produced improvements comparable to CBT-I in some outcome measures.</p>

        <h3>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation</h3>
        <p>Brain stimulation techniques are being investigated for insomnia, though the evidence is preliminary. A 2018 review in Frontiers in Psychiatry found mixed results for various neuromodulation approaches. This remains an area of active research without sufficient evidence for clinical recommendations.</p>

        <h2>How to Choose</h2>
        <p>The decision tree is more straightforward than the number of options suggests:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start with CBT-I</strong> if you can access it. In-person is ideal; digital is a reasonable alternative.</li>
            <li><strong>Add medication short-term</strong> if needed while CBT-I takes effect, or if CBT-I alone is insufficient. DORAs or low-dose doxepin have the most favorable risk-benefit profiles for most adults.</li>
            <li><strong>Address contributing conditions</strong> concurrently. Depression, anxiety, pain, and sleep apnea all need their own treatment.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid long-term use of sedative-hypnotics</strong> unless other options have been exhausted and the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Be skeptical of supplements</strong> marketed as sleep solutions. Most have weak evidence. Melatonin has a narrow set of conditions where it helps.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The most important step is talking to a healthcare provider who understands sleep medicine. A primary care physician can start the conversation, but a referral to a sleep specialist or behavioral sleep medicine provider gives you access to the full range of evidence-based options.</p>
