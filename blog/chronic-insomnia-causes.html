        <h1>Chronic Insomnia Causes: Why Your Brain Won't Let You Sleep</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Most people can point to the event that started their insomnia. A stressful job. A breakup. A new baby. What they can't explain is why the insomnia stayed long after that stressor was gone. Understanding why requires a different way of thinking about the condition.</p>

        <h2>The 3P Model: How Insomnia Becomes Chronic</h2>
        <p>In 1987, Arthur Spielman proposed a model that remains the most widely used framework for understanding chronic insomnia. It's called the 3P model: predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors.</p>

        <h3>Predisposing Factors</h3>
        <p>Some people are more vulnerable to insomnia than others. This isn't weakness; it's neurobiology. Research published in Sleep in 2010 by Drake and colleagues demonstrated that individuals with a high "sleep reactivity" trait, meaning their sleep is easily disrupted by stress, are significantly more likely to develop chronic insomnia when faced with life stressors.</p>
        <p>Other predisposing factors include a family history of insomnia (twin studies suggest heritability around 40%, according to a 2015 review in Sleep Medicine Reviews), female sex, older age, and a tendency toward anxiety or rumination. None of these factors cause insomnia by themselves, but they lower the threshold.</p>

        <h3>Precipitating Factors</h3>
        <p>These are the triggers. The stressful event, the medical illness, the job loss, the grief, the medication change. Nearly everyone can identify what started their insomnia. In a survey published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2014), the most commonly reported precipitants were work stress (32%), health concerns (25%), and family or relationship problems (21%).</p>
        <p>Acute insomnia triggered by life events is extremely common and usually self-limiting. Most people recover their sleep within days to weeks once the stressor resolves or they adapt to it. The question is: why doesn't everyone recover?</p>

        <h3>Perpetuating Factors</h3>
        <p>This is where the model gets interesting. Perpetuating factors are the behaviors, thoughts, and habits that people adopt in response to poor sleep, which end up maintaining the insomnia long after the original trigger is gone. They are the reason insomnia becomes chronic.</p>
        <p>Common perpetuating factors include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spending excessive time in bed.</strong> When people aren't sleeping well, they often go to bed earlier, sleep in later, or nap during the day to compensate. This dilutes sleep drive and fragments sleep further.</li>
            <li><strong>Irregular schedules.</strong> Sleeping late on weekends to "catch up" shifts the circadian rhythm and makes Monday night insomnia worse.</li>
            <li><strong>Clock watching.</strong> Checking the time during the night increases anxiety and arousal, making sleep less likely.</li>
            <li><strong>Catastrophic thinking about sleep.</strong> "If I don't sleep tonight, I'll be useless tomorrow" creates performance anxiety that is directly incompatible with sleep.</li>
            <li><strong>Using the bed for activities other than sleep.</strong> Working, scrolling, or watching television in bed weakens the bed-sleep association.</li>
            <li><strong>Using alcohol as a sleep aid.</strong> Alcohol induces sleep onset but fragments the second half of the night, worsening overall sleep quality.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-fact">
            <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> In most cases of chronic insomnia, the original trigger is no longer the primary driver. The coping strategies people adopt to deal with poor sleep become the main problem. CBT-I works by systematically dismantling these perpetuating factors.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Hyperarousal Theory</h2>
        <p>There's a second model that complements the 3P framework: hyperarousal. Research over the past two decades has established that people with chronic insomnia are not just failing to sleep at night. They are in a state of heightened physiological and cognitive arousal around the clock.</p>
        <p>A landmark 2001 study by Nofzinger and colleagues using PET brain imaging, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, found that patients with insomnia showed increased metabolism in brain regions associated with arousal and emotional regulation, both during sleep and during wakefulness. Their brains never fully downshifted.</p>
        <p>Subsequent research has confirmed this pattern across multiple measures. People with chronic insomnia show elevated cortisol levels (Vgontzas et al., 2001, Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism), increased heart rate variability consistent with sympathetic activation (Bonnet & Arand, 2010, Sleep Medicine Reviews), and higher core body temperature compared to normal sleepers.</p>
        <p>This hyperarousal isn't something people can simply turn off by trying to relax. It's a conditioned response that develops over months of associating the bed and bedtime with wakefulness and frustration. The bedroom becomes a cue for alertness rather than rest.</p>

        <h2>Medical Conditions That Contribute</h2>
        <p>Chronic insomnia doesn't exist in a vacuum. Several medical conditions can initiate or sustain it:</p>

        <h3>Depression and Anxiety</h3>
        <p>The relationship between insomnia and psychiatric conditions is bidirectional. Depression doesn't just cause insomnia; insomnia significantly increases the risk of developing depression. A meta-analysis by Baglioni and colleagues published in the Journal of Affective Disorders (2011) found that people with insomnia had a twofold increased risk of developing depression compared to those without sleep problems. Treatment that addresses both conditions simultaneously produces better outcomes than treating either alone.</p>

        <h3>Chronic Pain</h3>
        <p>Pain disrupts sleep, and poor sleep lowers pain thresholds. A 2015 study in the journal Pain found that experimental sleep restriction increased pain sensitivity in healthy volunteers, and clinical studies consistently show that insomnia treatment improves pain outcomes in patients with chronic pain conditions. The relationship is cyclical: breaking the insomnia component often helps the pain component and vice versa.</p>

        <h3>Sleep Apnea</h3>
        <p>Obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia co-occur more frequently than would be expected by chance. The combination, sometimes called comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA), affects an estimated 30 to 50 percent of patients presenting with either condition, according to a 2019 review in Sleep Medicine Reviews. Both conditions need to be identified and treated. Treating insomnia alone won't fix apnea, and many patients with apnea continue to have insomnia even after starting CPAP therapy.</p>

        <h3>Menopause</h3>
        <p>The hormonal changes of perimenopause and menopause are strongly associated with insomnia onset. The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) found that sleep difficulty increased from 33% to 53% across the menopausal transition. Hot flashes directly fragment sleep, but hormonal changes also independently affect sleep architecture. This is one of the reasons insomnia is roughly twice as common in women as in men.</p>

        <h3>Medications</h3>
        <p>Numerous medications can cause or worsen insomnia as a side effect. Common culprits include corticosteroids, beta-blockers, SSRI antidepressants (particularly in early treatment), stimulant medications, decongestants containing pseudoephedrine, and thyroid hormones. If insomnia onset coincides with a medication change, that connection deserves investigation.</p>

        <h2>The Role of Genetics</h2>
        <p>Insomnia runs in families, and research is beginning to identify why. A large genome-wide association study published in Nature Genetics (2019) by Jansen and colleagues identified 202 genetic loci associated with insomnia complaints, many of which were linked to genes involved in stress reactivity and neuronal development. The authors estimated that genetics account for roughly 40% of the variance in insomnia risk.</p>
        <p>This doesn't mean insomnia is predetermined. It means some people are working with a nervous system that's more easily tipped into the hyperaroused state that sustains chronic insomnia. Understanding this can reduce the self-blame that many patients carry, and it underscores why behavioral intervention (changing the perpetuating factors) is more practical than trying to change your biology.</p>

        <h2>Why Understanding Causes Matters for Treatment</h2>
        <p>Knowing what's driving your insomnia changes what you should do about it. If the cause is primarily circadian (shift work, jet lag, delayed phase), timing-based interventions like light therapy and melatonin make sense. If perpetuating behavioral factors are the main issue, CBT-I is the clear first step. If a medical condition is contributing, that needs concurrent treatment.</p>
        <p>What rarely helps is doing nothing different and hoping the insomnia resolves on its own. For acute insomnia, that might work. For chronic insomnia, the perpetuating factors typically ensure that it won't. The sooner you address them, the easier they are to reverse.</p>
